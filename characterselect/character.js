They spat at him, slung slurs, and shattered what little hope he had been building up over the last year. He crawled away and nursed himself back to health, then went to the guards.

            "Was found by his soon to be master, Master Fuu Nel, and brought into the Temple of Flowing Water.",
            "Hong was always treated like an outcast. He had very few memories before the monastery, but he 'knew' what happened. He kept to himself and lashed out when people prodded him.",
            "He always had anger problems. He wanted to know where he came from so he could seek vengeance, but Fuu Nel would merely take him to a garden and worked on meditation.",
            "Hong slowly grew to not want vengeance, instead focusing on making sure he could prevent it from happening again.",
            "Sadly, when he turned 18, it happened again. Fuu Nel sent him out on a simple errand to prove himself worthy of leaving the monastery. When he returned, everything was destroyed.",
            "Unable to cope with the idea that everyone he ever knew was dead, Hong ran. He latched onto the only evidence he could find, and he started his hunt for vengeance. ",
            "At first he thought his temple had been destroyed by a dragon cult, and while it was partially right, he found out the real truth later. The temple had a magical barrier around it that prevented those that wished to do harm from ever finding it. All the negative energy that built up over time eroded the protection until the cult could just walk through.",
            "After finding out that his angry outbursts as a child helped cause the deaths of everyone, Hong felt extreme guilt. He swore he'd try and contain his anger from then on, and promised he'd make Fuu Nel proud.",
            "",
            "Hong travels a bit around with various groups, doing good where he can.",
            "Eventually settles down a bit and decides to build a place where people in need can turn to, so he builds an orphanage. He knew the pain of losing everyone, and he wanted to make sure no one else would have to deal with that pain alone.",
            "He still adventures, bringing in resources and funds for those he takes care of to this day."

Unlike other necromancers though, he doesn't force the soul back into the body. He doesn't prevent it from being ressurrected. He mearly puppets the bodies with extensions of his own soul."

Afterwards, she left his egg at a Bahamut temple. Durring his childhood, he stayed hid away inside of the temple, having few friends and the surrounding areas being not the most dragonkin 'friendly'. He had dreams of a paternal dragonborn whom he could only describe as being 'platinum'. These dreams comforted him, helped guide him in his studies, and made him feel like he belonged and was loved.",
            "Around the age of 9 or 10, Jhankdi spent time training to get his 'magic license', and met Kiva of Drah. He was a little childish, a tad bit foolhardy, and oozed confidence and curiosity. He tried to fight like the showboaty fighters he saw, but his lack of grace caused him to constantly fail. He thought it was a lack of experience, and continued to train.",
            "At age 12, Jhankdi joined a skrimish, with the backing of his temple, with other warriors of Bahamut. He first saw his oldest sister Aryduun here, and felt a strange, almost inate connection with her. Having fully devoted his life to Bahamut, Jhankdi acted less like a cleric, and more.. like an Inquisitor. He charged in head first, and was quickly knocked over and impailed. He lost consciousness.",
            "He spent a few days in bed, drifitn in and out. He had many fever dreams, and his fear of death grew exponentially. His doubt in his abilities flourished.",
            "When he became both physically and emotionally stable enough to leave his room, he limped about the camp. A sound of metal clanging at first brought him back to that moment of utter failure.. but then he felt drawn to it at the same time. He found smiths, working on repairing armor from the long fight. The heat was sweltering, and made his cold blood uncomfortably hot. But he couldn't stop watching. One of the smiths saw his interest, and offered to teach him a bit. The heat was hard on him, but he pressed on. His sister watched over him as he started to learn. Eventually, with Bahamut's blessing, he started following Gonds teachings, setting him on the path to become a master smith.",

He's closed off from people, especially humans and elves, due to his half elven nature and his experiences. He is wary of dwarves, having learned the elven ways, but he isn't flat out racist against them. (More of a 'If Elves dislike dwarves, dwarves probably dislike elves. Better be careful.')",
            "When he finally warms up to people, he has a big heart. He wants to help people, he wants to be good, the darkness around him just makes it hard to have the energy to do so all the time. He's pretty adverse to doing horrific acts, and will become conflicted if he is forced to for a reason.",

He doesn't want to do the bad thing, but he's more likely to because the only person who makes him feel alive is at risk.",
            "Tysshyr almost seems confident in everything he does, but it's more his well 'learned' nature of not fearing death, because there's nothing to live for. He has moments where he'll snap out of it, usually when he thinks of Dro, and he's been trying hard as of late to turn his 'self preservation' back on."

There's couches, chairs, some coin, but this is a dragon who hoards things he likes, not things that shine and glitter.",

            "When Tysshyr was born, his parents moved to a small village to raise him. Before his first birthday, his mother became fed up with 'living like humans' and took off, leaving his father to raise Tysshyr alone. His father decided to give Tysshyr the best elven childhood a human could.",
            "Tysshyr grew up the only elvish boy in a small village full of humans. He was teased, and was a bit of an outcast, but he did manage to make friends after a while. While he wasn't the most popular, he had friends, even though he grew up slower than the other children.",
            "The hardest thing for him was the confusion of being raised elvish, while everyone around else was raised with normal childhoods. The fact that he grew and developed slower also factored in. Friends he made young didn't stay friends with the 'weird kid' who acted like such a 'baby'.",
            "He didn't feel like he fit in, but he enjoyed his childhood.",
            "At the age of 18, his father suddenly came down with an illness. 5 months later, he lost the battle and Tysshyr had to bury the only family member he had. The people of the village mourned more for his father then they showed concern for him, so Tysshyr decided to travel. Home reminded him of what he lost, and he couldn't cope with it.",
            "He spent the last few years of his 'childhood' as a mercenary. He wasn't the best, but he was willing to take risks, and he made it through every increasingly dangerous situation. He made friends, he gained a name for himself, and if it was anyone else he'd be content with what he had.",
            "But Tysshyr had a hole in his heart that nothing seemed to fill. He had everything, but felt like he had nothing. He made up his mind on what to do.",
            "He threw the biggest of parties at the best of inns. He paid for everything with his savings. He gave away things he didn't need as gifts. He had one great night with everyone he ever knew.",
            "Then in the dead of night, he slipped out for a one man mission. There was a rumor that a dragon had made a nest in a nearby cave, he'd either slay it, or he'd die trying. Honestly, he was hoping for the latter.",
            "When he arrived there, he readied himself and charged in. Indeed there was a dragon there. A brass dragon. Tysshyr was taken aback by the shear size of the beast, but none of his weapons fazed the dragon. Instead it looked at him curiously. \"Who wounded you child?\"",
            "Tysshyr broke down. Tears started to grow in his eyes. He couldn't take it anymore. The dragon watched in horror as Tysshyr plunged his dagger into the side of his neck.",
            "He awoke days later, his neck in pain. No weapons, stripped down to his skivvies. The Dragon stood before him, in the form of a dragonborn. The dragon, Skinaszkdro'xnir, explained how he shared his draconic blood with the half elf boy, an ancient and powerful way fueled by the platinum dragon to restore a life to one who didn't deserve to lose it. With the urge to die (again) quelled, and some prodding from the curious dragon led Tysshyr to tell his life story. He vented everything. His insecurities of being an Elf, his inability to feel like he belonged or deserved to be with people, the pain of losing the only person who ever cared, his confused thoughts about his elvish heritage and the thoughts he had of his mother, and many more.",
            "For what could have easily been a whole 24 hours, Tysshyr decompressed for the first time in his life.",
            "The Brass dragon, who told Tysshyr to refer to him as Dro, tended to him while he recovered. For the first time in years, Tysshyr felt like someone cared, like he had a reason to live.",
            "They eventually had a heart to heart talk, where Dro admitted he wanted to see Tysshyr smile. This made him blush, and after a confusing night of sorting out feelings, Tysshyr did something he never thought possible.",
            "Not only was he in a relationship, but he was in one with a male, and a male dragon at that.",
            "They've been together for almost a year, Dro gifted Tysshyr with small trinkets, and eventually sharing some magical secrets and items with him.",
            "Recently, Tysshyr's been bothered with something. Recent scars don't seem to heal right, even with magical healing."

His violet eyes are persistent throughout his forms, unless he purposely changes form to something outside his norm. ,Dro has spent his long life observing 'mortals', but was always weary of them. He had grown used to settling down somewhere, only to have a few brave knights or adventuring groups attempt to root out the 'evil dragon' who someone found. Typically he luls them into a sleep with his breath, then uses magic to convince them of a dream. He's never had to 'put down' a humanoid who wandered into his cave, and he's quite happy with himself that he's been able to be so gentle with the tiny people. ,He enjoys teasing Tysshyr light heartedly. He claims that the half elf's blush and smile are one of the greatest treasures in his possession. Dro is more than likely Pansexual, caring not for parts, but more for the experiences and pleasures. There was an awkward story of helping Tysshyr discover his own sexuality, and dragon shapeshifting into various forms. He found out he was gay when the sexxy dragonborn turned into a big breasted elven woman and his boner completely died. X3,Dro is protective, but he wants what's best for his little 'gem'.

It had magically created food, it was highly defensible, and it didn't seem like anyone knew where it was. Without the constant threat of survival, the natural ingenuity of kobolds came out in full force. They had time to study, to create, to invent. The concept of 'Tucker's Kobolds' is basically their bible. Craftsmen, Artificers, Sorcerers, even some wizards and other types of casters florished. They were encouraged to explore what every they were interested in so they could contribute something new to the warren."

With everyone helping each other, Kaiex got to explore all kinds of crafts. Without a true spark of magic, he focused on weapons. Big, strong, powerful weapons, with dreams of making weapons that no kobold had ever wielded. He trained, he pushed himself. He trained his body and his mind, becoming strong physically, and intellectually.",

He leapt to battle, boomerang sword in hand, and did what he had to to keep his tribe safe. He fought as well as he could, but the dragon sent him flying through one of their escape tunnels, causing it to collapse atop of him. He woke up later, managing to have pulled himself out of the rubble, mostly. His tail had been crushed, and pinched off, leaving him with only a nub. The sounds of combat didn't carry through the collapsed tunnel, leaving him with only his thoughts of what <i>could</i> have happened. Had they all died? Had he failed? N..No! Maybe the dragon stole them.. Or they drove the dragon off. He'd have to find his way back.",

            "His parents were expecting twins. They were excited to have two little bundles of joy, yet when the 'big day' came, they only had one. Barnaby was born an only child, and seemed pretty normal, even if he looked so strangely unique. It wasn't until he got older that his parents noticed a strange behavior. Somedays he'd be quiet and reserved, other days he'd be loud and playful. It wasn't until he was around 6, when Barnaby went exploring in their attic and found remannts of his old baby things. What confused him is that there were some things embroidered with the name 'Remmington' or 'Remmy', as well as his own. A part of him couldn't drop it, he just had to know. So he asked. His parents reluctantly explained it as best as they could to such a small child, and something just clicked within him. Remmy.",
            "Much to his parents horror, the next day he swore up and down that he was Remmy! That was his name, and the little fawn caused all kinds of trouble over it. At first, they thought their swift punishments worked, the next day their fawn would be back to normal, but it never went away fully. A few years passed, Barnaby and Remmy becoming more and more their own distict personalities. His parents latest tactic was a scare. They had a priest use zone of truth to try and force him to drop the charade. The only problem was that Remmy was fully telling the truth. He saw Barnaby as his brother, his name was Remmy, and Barnaby was inside him. Exasperated, they approached a professor of a wizard college.",
            "Several deep magical scans were done, both on his body and mind. It wasn't until someone thought to try testing his soul, that they got results. Instead of a single soul, his body contained two. Theories started, more tests happened, and an opprituinty opened up to them. The chance to 'study' at one of the top Magical Colleges in the land. Without true magical potential, it was honestly a way for those studying them to keep the growing fawn close, but his parents saw it as a chance for something great. At 13, he started his true studies, sitting in on various classes. Mostly history, and other non magical topics. Potion brewing became a place to explore and experiment, without the need of magic getting in the way.",
            "His first year revealed that he was rather smart for his age, and he had a massive tallent for alchemical tinkering. While the days Remmy was in front weren't his best academically, even Remmy was shown to have the capacity to be highly intelligent. It was impossible for the growing boy to not stand out, and other students didn't appreciate him standing out so much. One day the tension became too much, and someone challenged him to an official duel. Normally, it would be magic only, but with Remmy whispering in ideas for Barnaby to push for, a contract was drawn up with the exact rules for their duel. It included 'any skill that was taught in the institution.', and was agreed upon and signed. The next day, Remmy fronted, coming in with a bag of premade bombs, and utterly dominated the battle infront of most of the school. After that, Barnaby and Remmy were free to officially join the Alchemy tract, and were seen as fellow students.",
            "They started to plow through their degrees. Barnaby focusing on more on medicinal effects, while Remmy developed their bomb system to be more flexible. Barnaby is currently working on his doctorate, something that Remmy has gone on record saying that he doesn't want to get in the way or be involved with, as much as possible."
